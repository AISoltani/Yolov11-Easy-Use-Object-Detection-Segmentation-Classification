## Introduction

This repository implements the latest version of the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection model, specifically **YOLOv11**, as introduced by the Ultralytics team. YOLOv11 brings a variety of enhancements and optimizations compared to its predecessors, making it one of the most efficient and accurate models available for object detection.

The goal of this repository is to allow users to quickly and easily use YOLOv11 for object detection tasks, train custom datasets, and perform model inference with ease. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, YOLOv11 offers a powerful tool for your computer vision tasks.

## Key Improvements in YOLOv11

Compared to previous versions of YOLO, YOLOv11 introduces several key improvements aimed at enhancing performance, accuracy, and ease of use:

1. **Backbone Optimization**: YOLOv11 uses an updated backbone network that provides better feature extraction with lower computational cost, leading to faster inference and training.

2. **Improved Head Design**: The detection head has been refined to improve localization and classification accuracy, particularly for smaller objects that were challenging in earlier versions.

3. **Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)**: The FPN architecture in YOLOv11 has been improved to handle multi-scale object detection better, ensuring more accurate detections across varying object sizes.

4. **Dynamic Anchor Boxes**: Instead of using fixed anchor boxes, YOLOv11 dynamically adjusts anchors during training to better match object aspect ratios, which increases the model's performance in various scenarios.

5. **Transformer Augmentations**: YOLOv11 incorporates advanced transformer-based techniques for improving long-range dependencies, which boosts the detection of objects even in cluttered or complex environments.

6. **Optimized Training Procedures**: By introducing novel training strategies and optimizations, YOLOv11 achieves better results with fewer epochs, making it more time-efficient to train on custom datasets.

7. **Improved Post-Processing**: Post-processing techniques such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) have been enhanced to reduce false positives and improve overall detection quality.
